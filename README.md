### Q2.) What is MVC pattern?
```markdown

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.
It’s a software design pattern used in Laravel to separate concerns:

- Model handles the data and business logic
- View displays the UI (usually Blade templates)
- Controller connects the model to the view — handles user input and passes data

Laravel follows this structure to keep your code clean and maintainable.
